# Blue Fire Rando
A **very** work-in-progress randomiser for Blue Fire - too long a work-in-progress really >:p

- So the whole idea of the program is to provide an easy-to-set-up game mode where pickups such as tunics, spirits and emotes are shuffled in a random order while the game itself is still beatable without glitches to provide a different gameplay experience
- The main inspiration for this was the Hollow Knight Randomiser which is masterfully made
- While Blue Fire is not a fully fledged metroidvania I firmly believe a randomiser would add some gameplay variety and allow for more replayability

- Thank you to localcc's [rust rewrite](https://github.com/AstroTechies/unrealmodding/tree/main/unreal_asset) of atenfyr's [UAssetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) which is used for asset editing! This includes parsing of exports + editing and adding of PropertyData in each export + even more! The APIs are extremely extensive and this program would be impossible without them so thank you so much to both of them ðŸ˜Š
